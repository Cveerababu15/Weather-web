# Weather-web
This React Weather App lets you quickly check live weather for any city. Type a city in the search bar, hit search, and it fetches data from OpenWeather API showing temperature, humidity, and conditions. I am workin on the Voice integration based on the city i will fetch same like how input works ,if you want to try it go Head!
